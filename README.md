# Fintech Production Engineering Sample

This repository showcases my production engineering work for a fintech platform Iâ€™m building. It focuses on Dockerization and CI/CD pipelines for both frontend and backend services. The goal of this sample is to demonstrate how I approach real-world DevOps workflows using GitHub Actions and Docker.

##  Whatâ€™s Included

This is a stripped-down version of a larger platform. I've extracted only the parts that reflect my work in production engineering:

### GitHub Actions Pipelines
Located in `.github/workflows/`

- **backend.yml** â€“ Builds, tests, and optionally deploys the backend service.
- **frontend.yml** â€“ Handles build and deploy steps for the frontend (Next.js) app.


These workflows automate testing, building Docker images, and preparing for deployment in staging/production environments.

---

### Dockerfiles

- **Dockerfile.backend** â€“ Defines a container image for the backend API (Node.js + TypeScript).
- **Dockerfile.frontend** â€“ Dockerfile for the frontend (Next.js + TypeScript).
- **Dockerfile.backend.dev / Dockerfile.frontend.dev** â€“ Development versions of the above for local use with hot-reloading.

These files are designed to support both local development and production-ready builds.

---

### Docker Compose

- **docker-compose.yml** â€“ Spins up both the frontend and backend in development.
- **docker-compose.prod.yml** â€“ Used for production builds and container orchestration.

These files define service dependencies, environment variables, and port mappings for a seamless multi-container setup.

## What I Learned

Working on this platform gave me hands-on experience with:
- Creating automated pipelines using GitHub Actions
- Writing optimized and clean Dockerfiles
- Using Docker Compose to manage multiple services
- Managing separate environments for development and production
- Ensuring code quality through automated linting and testing
- Structuring CI workflows that are scalable and maintainable

## ðŸ”’ Note

This is a sample focused on production engineering. The actual business logic and application secrets have been removed to protect project integrity. If youâ€™d like more details or walkthroughs, Iâ€™m happy to share privately during an interview.
